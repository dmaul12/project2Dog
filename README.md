# project2CitiBike

As a user the user will be able to request the number of Citi Bikes available per location. So if the user wanted to know how many bikes are available at the W 52nd location, the user can see the number of bikes in the dock.

Also, the user can check if the destination station has available docks available. So if the user's destination is Atlantic & Furman Street location, the user can see the number of docks available.

Both filter functions allow the user to know beforehand if bikes or docks are availble. This saves time and hassle for the users.

The login in feature will save the users past start and destination stations.
